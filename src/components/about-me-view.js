        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>I am a T-Shaped Java Developer with strong technical background, experience in agile development methodology, requirements engineering, supplemented by industry knowledge in banks and insurance. Since 2009 I work as an IT Consultant  in the financial services industry. 
        In those years, I saw a wide variety of different projects: Core bank migration, software renewal, extensions of standard software as well as individual development. The software was sometimes developed onshore, sometimes nearshore or offshore.</p>
